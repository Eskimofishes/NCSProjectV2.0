  - Hey! Over here!
  - "God has not forsaken me for me to be able to meet another person this far out.
    \nI am Priest Takil, I come from a village not far from here."
  - I was supposed to hunt some rabbits but God suddenly prevented me from doing
    it myself, darn.
  - 'It must have been fate for you to come across me today.

    HE prevents me
    from hunting, but he sends me a proxy instead HAHA.

    You shall hunt the rabbits
    for me.'
  - 'Bah, you are young and strong, stop whining.

    I''ll give you a place to
    stay for the night and cook you a meal.

    Now just go already!'

    Go get me 7 pieces of rabbit meat, that should be
    enough for the 2 of us.'
